# Instructions 

The aim of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to sharpen your skills in using ggplot(). While some of the plots you create may resemble those we covered in class, it is essential that they are original. 
 
 Rules for the Assignment:
 
 1.All data sets except iris are fair game. That includes past datasets used in the class, sets built into R, your own data, and even online data.
 
 2. All graphs must include axis labels, plot title, a theme of your choice, and a brief description/interpretation of the plot (2-3 sentences).


It's worth noting that ggplot() is a widely-used tool, and there are numerous online resources available for you to explore. We strongly recommend that you take advantage of these resources to deepen your understanding of ggplot().
