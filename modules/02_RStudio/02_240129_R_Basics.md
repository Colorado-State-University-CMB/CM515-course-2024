# What is R?



## R is a programming language
 * designed for statistics, plotting, & data analysis
 * comprised of a base package that can be functionality expanded through add-on packages
 * open-source
 * an interpreted language

## R is an ecosystem
 * the base package - R
 * the extended environment - packages, RStudio, documentation
 * the repository - CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)
 * the governance, support, & organization - R Core Development Team, R Foundation, R Consortium, RStudio
 * the contribution community - developers
 * the user community - us



## How did R come to be?


<img src="webContent/Founders.jpeg" width="600">

  * 1976 - Bell Labs develops S, an open-source statistical programming language. The team was led by John Chambers.
  * 1991 - Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Aukland in New Zealand embarks on a research venture to adapt S into R. 
    * Motivated to create a better user experience for academics
  * 1995 - first official beta release
  * 1997 - CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) distributes R packages
  * 1997 - R Core Team, a governing body, is founded
  * 2000 - R 1.0.0 is released 
  * 2011 - R versions start getting funny nicknames. R 2.14.0 Great Pumpkin
  * 2010 - CRAN exceeds 10,000 published packages!
  * 2024 - R's latest version is 4.3.2 "Eye Holes"
  * 2024 - Estimated 2 million R users worldwide (91,000 women registered in the R-Ladies user group)
  * [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) - great for keeping up with new developments

R is now a large, diverse community of users and developers. Here is a picture from the 2018 New York R conference courtesy of R-Bloggers:

>  “R changed my opinion of humanity to some extent, to see how people are really willing to freely give of themselves and produce something larger than themselves without any thought of personal glory. There’s a lot of work with no recognition.” - Ross Ihaka

## Why do we use R in computational biology?

❓ Why do we use any programming language in biology? 

❓ Why use R in particular? What are its benefits for the life sciences?

## Bioconductor

[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) serves as a repository for life science relevant R packages

## HOMEWORK QUESTION 1 (5 pts) 

:white_check_mark: The purpose is to build curiosity. Students can imagine what R packages will work for their individual goals and projects.

A. Answer the following: **What is your field of research?** You can use a rotation project or in-lab project. If you don't have a designated field of research, what is a field you would like to move into in the future?

B. Think about the research you would like to do. Use the [Bioconductor Website](https://www.bioconductor.org/) to explore topics that are relevant to you. Answer the following: **What are the names and url's of 2 - 3 packages you would be interested to learn more about?**

C. Evaluate the documentation your packages have available. Compare the documentation between the 2 - 3 packages you selected. Answer: **Which packages appear easier to learn and why?**
